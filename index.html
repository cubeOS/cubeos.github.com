        	<strong>CubeOS</strong> is an open source operating system for the DCPU-16 with primary focus on fast and efficient computation. It is currently in pre-alpha state, much like 0x10c itself, but includes a primitive shell, <i>dash</i>, and a lightweight but functional kernal with subroutines for handling textual output, packing and unpacking ASCII, and more, with more to come.
